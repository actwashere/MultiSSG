# MultiSSG
An AHK script for Multi Instance 1.17 SSG

## How To
Make sure you have OBS open.
Download the [Latest Release](/owner/name/releases/latest/download/asset-name.zip), make sure to keep the .ahk files in the same spot.

Change the configurable variables, then run the script.
Once the script is running, press the `INS` button, then follow the instructions in the pop up box.

To reset, press `PG UP`. You can change these hotkeys at the bottom of the script.

This relies on having OBS open, and having the [1.17 Fast Reset mod](https://github.com/jan-leila/FastReset/releases/tag/1.17.1-1.0.0).
